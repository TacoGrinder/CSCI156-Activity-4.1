Chapter 4 – day 1

1. Write a procedure that uses a for loop to print out the first 20 integers.

2. Write a procedure that uses a for loop to find the sum of the first 100 integers.

3. Write a function called fact() that will compute and print n!, n factorial. Recall that n! is defined so that
0! = 1
1! = 1
2! = 2*1 = 2
3! = 3*2*1 = 6
4! = 4*3! = 4*3*2*1

Your function should have one parameter, m. 

Code outline:

def fact(m)
      <stuff>

fact(0)
fact(1)
fact(2)
fact(3)
fact(4)
fact(5)

Output:
1
1
2
6
24
120
